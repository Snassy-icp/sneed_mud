Combat System Specification
=======================

1. Overview
-----------
The combat system in SNEED MUD is a turn-based PvP system with cooldowns, combat states, and death mechanics.

2. Key Components
----------------
- Combat State Tracking
- Attack Processing
- Damage Calculation
- Death & Respawn System

3. Detailed Mechanics
--------------------
Combat State:
- Players enter combat state when attacking or being attacked
- Combat state lasts 20 seconds from the last combat action
- Players must wait 5 seconds between attacks (cooldown)

Frontend Auto-Attack Feature:
- The UI can assist players by automating attack commands
- Initiated by /attack command, creates a UI timer matching attack cooldown
- Automatically sends subsequent /attack commands when cooldown expires
- Stops automatically if:
  * Player uses /stop command
  * Player moves to different room
  * Target dies or leaves room
  * Any attack command fails (excluding normal combat misses/glancing blows)
- Must fully respect all backend cooldowns and combat rules
- Purely a UI convenience feature with no backend state

Attack Process:
- Attacker and target must be in the same room
- System verifies attacker can perform combat actions
- Damage is calculated based on attacker's level
- Target's HP is reduced by damage amount
- Both players enter combat state

Death & Respawn:
- Players die when HP reaches 0
- Auto-respawn occurs 60 seconds after death
- Manual respawn available when dead
- Respawn restores full HP
- Players respawn in starting room (room 0)

XP System:
- XP awarded for killing players
- XP amount = target's level * 10
- Base XP of 10 if target has no level

4. Constants & Formulas
----------------------
Timings:
- Combat Duration: 20 seconds
- Attack Cooldown: 5 seconds
- Respawn Delay: 60 seconds

Damage Formula:
- Base Damage = (Attacker's Level * 20) + 10
