SNEED MUD - Technical Assumptions
================================

This document lists the core technical assumptions that inform the design of all game systems.

1. Internet Computer Platform Constraints
---------------------------------------
- Update calls have 1-2 second latency (minimum)
- Query calls should not exceed once per second frequency
- State updates and combat actions must account for these latencies
- All timing values in specifications must respect these technical limitations

Impact:
- All game systems must be designed with these constraints in mind
- Timing values in specifications must allow for these latencies
- User interface must account for expected delays
- Game mechanics should feel natural despite these constraints
